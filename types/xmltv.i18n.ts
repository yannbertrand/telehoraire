	 * Star rating' - many listings guides award a programme a score as a quick guide to how good it is.
	 * The value of this element should be 'N / M', for example one star out of a possible five stars would be '1 / 5'.
	 *
	 * Zero stars is also a possible score (and not the same as 'unrated').  You should try to map whatever wacky system
	 * your listings source uses to a number of stars: so for example if they have thumbs up, thumbs sideways and thumbs down,
	 * you could map that to two, one or zero stars out of two.
	 *
	 * If a programme is marked as recommended in a listings guide you could map this to '1 / 1'.
	 *
	 * Because there could be many ways to provide star-ratings or recommendations for a programme, you can specify
	 * multiple star-ratings. You can specify the star-rating system used, or the provider of the recommendation,
	 * with the system attribute. Whitespace between the numbers and slash is ignored.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```typescript
	 * {
	 *   starRating: [{
	 *     value: '1 / 5',
	 *     system: 'IMDB',
	 *     icon: {
